        <h2>From Coffee Bean to Coffee Cup</h2>

        <p>
            We know what it’s like to get that intense craving for a great tasting cup of coffee. 
            At This Little Café, we believe that everyone deserves coffee that is both delicious 
            and made from high-quality beans. That is why we only use fresh coffee beans from 
            Velvet Sunrise Coffee Roasters right here in Stouffville, Ontario in every pot and 
            espresso-based drink. We have also partnered with Batter’s Up Custom Cakes to bring 
            you fresh baked goods made locally with care. Come enjoy a pastry with a cup of coffee 
            or a specialty drink made just for you.
        </p>

            We are so excited to reopen after a long COVID-19 closure inside the Magna Centre at 
            800 Mulock Drive, Newmarket. We are back with a new name, fresh look, and incredible 
            new products. It’s still us — Robin & Jason Groves — operating This Little Café since 
            2010. We are committed to supporting local businesses and offering the best products 
            from our community. We can’t wait to serve old and new friends very soon.
