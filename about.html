       We know what it’s like to get that intense craving for a great tasting cup of coffee. At This little Cafe, we believe that everyone deserves coffee that is both delicious and from beans of the top quality. That is why we only use fresh coffee beans from Velvet Sunrise Coffee Roasters right here in Stouffville, Ontario in every pot of coffee and in our espresso base drinks. We have also partnered with another small local business Batter’s Up Custom Cakes owned and operated by Celeste Groves. All of the fresh baked goods that will be featured at our cafe will be provided by Batter’s Up. Come try and enjoy some fabulous fresh pastries with a cup of coffee or specialty hot or cold drink made special just for you.
