                 We know what it’s like to get that intense craving for a great tasting cup of coffee. At This little Cafe, we believe that everyone deserves coffee that is both delicious and from beans of the top quality. That is why we only use fresh coffee beans from Velvet Sunrise Coffee Roasters right here in Stouffville, Ontario in every pot of coffee and in our espresso base drinks. We have also partnered with another small local business Batter’s Up Custom Cakes owned and operated by Celeste Groves. All of the fresh baked goods that will be featured at our cafe will be provided by Batter’s Up. Come try and enjoy some fabulous fresh pastries with a cup of coffee or specialty hot or cold drink made special just for you. We are so excited to reopen after a long COVID-19 closure inside the Magna Centre at 800 Mulock Drive Newmarket, Ontario. We are back with a brand new name & look plus all new amazing products. It’s still us Robin & Jason Groves operating This little Cafe since 2010. We have spent some time sourcing out as many local business as we could. Partnering up with some amazing small business to offer you some fabulous new product. Supporting as many local business in our community and surrounding area will be our primary focus. We are looking forward to serving some old and new friends at the cafe real soon.
